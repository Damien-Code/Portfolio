# Portfolio
This is my first of many school projects. In this projects we needed to make a portfolio website.
There also was the task to intergrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) into this project.
I did it in a way so other users could also make their own portfolio and add it to my website.

# What I learned:
I learned a lot during this first period. I knew some things about HTML and CSS but none to big.
Sometimes it was a real challenge but i really started to like to push myself to learn new things.

There were so many new things to learn, but PHP stands out the most. I like the versatility of it. I never knew you
could intergrate it with HTML. It made it so much easier to learn because you could immediately see the result.
I don't know to many coding languages yet, but it is my favorite one so far!
I am really excited for next period when we get to learn about the Laravel framework!


# What will be next...
Next period I will be learning about intergrating users. It probably will be a new project
but because I really like this project so much, I want to intergrate it in this project as well.
So no users for now, but it is coming!
